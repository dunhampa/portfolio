##Summary
This site design (in progress!). I developed this site using Bootstrap3.0's grid system to allow for responsive design. I built the site with HTML5 and used custom CSS to tweak some things. The animation in the circle shows how the site will re-order columns to rows depending on the device size or browswer resize/zoom.

##Technologies:
HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap3.0, Git, GitHub
